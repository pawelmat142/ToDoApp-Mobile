## General info
 This app will be mobile version of my [To-Do List](https://github.com/pawelmat142/ToDo-List-Angular) and is in progress. <br />
 At the moment it works with device storage and I'm working on integrating the app with the API of my backend ToDo List app. <br />
 
 The motivation to do the task was to learn the Ionic Framework and make my ToDo List as mobile app. <br /> 
 I wanted also deep into how to work with device storage and improve my app with offline mode. <br />

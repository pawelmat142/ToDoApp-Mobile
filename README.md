## General info
 This app is mobile version of my Angular [To-Do List](https://github.com/pawelmat142/ToDo-List-Angular). <br />
 This mobile version works with same [backend application](https://github.com/pawelmat142/ToDo-List-backend) and API as my Angular version of ToDo List app. <br />
 There is also implemented notepad feature and offline mode feature built with local storage. <br />
